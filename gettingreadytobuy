Real Estate is either the best decision of you life or the largest mistake you can make short of a bad
life partner choice. When you purchase real estate whether you are an investor or owner occupant you
should always look at resale prospects for the investment. 

* Are you an investor or owner occupant purchaser if so in either case you should:
* find a trust worthy realtor
* find your lender 
* establish the purchase criteria including the amount of cash for down payment and closing cost.
* find your price range
* choose type of dwelling single family residential/multifamily/condo/townhome
* location  is the only thing that can't be fixed.
* establish type acreage-acreage range/platted subdivision with or 
  without recorded restrictions and covenants and size patio or 
  -.25/-.5/>.5 acres
* remember that women buy on emotion and have trouble envisioning things that are stumbling blocks for them.
* If you have children of school age you want to consider the school zones and ratings when working for a location.
* allow your realtor to do his job and search for the homes that meets your criteria
  perhaps drive thru the subdivisions he recommends choose your choice of subdivisions.   
* Investors:
* establish the $ amt you want to spend. 
* choose acceptable areas of town
* have your realtor to build a custom search for your criteria. 
  based on your criteria or price range. I have some that want to see all in some 
  small target areas and others that want to see all cheap properties that appear to have immediate equity. 
  


Is the property something that will provide 
shelter, security and a good ROI? Is the subdivision in a state of appreciation or is it headed down? 
As an investor what are the class of tennants going to be? The wrong tennants can be very costly. 
There are rules of thumb that could be of help to investors one of those is the gross rent multiplier 
this is not fixed in stone but a good rule of thumb... monthly rent times < 100 will provide a reasonable income. 
the lower the number the better the investment.. a property purchased for 100k should rent for $1,000.00 or more.
